This mod won't add a great deal out of vanilla other than a few extra weapons, items, supplies etc. 
The mod will focus on adding variants to vanilla weapons, for example the ice blade, there will be the flame blade, poison blade,
 same design but different features with buffs and debuffs on elemental damage based on the biome.
